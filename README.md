This repository is meant to document api features of minetest games needed to mod them that I had difficulty finding docs for

very wip by a programming beginner

docs:

[voxelibre mob notes](https://github.com/Darth-Tiktaalik/minetest-missing-docs/blob/main/voxelibre_mobs_notes.md), listing out mcl_mobs (and mcl_structures) details I needed to know when converting zombies4test mobs from mobs redo to voxelibre's mcl_mobs


Official documentation Hall of fame 

[repixture](https://codeberg.org/Wuzzy/Repixture) by Wuzzy properly documents it's api, and refers you to relevant docs if it's expected that the needed functionality might involve calling functions from multiple mods.
